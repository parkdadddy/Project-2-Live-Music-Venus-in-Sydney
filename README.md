# Project-2-Live-Music-Venus-in-Sydney

Last year, I finished my honours thesis on Live Music Ecology in the realm of urban planning. So in this project, I would like to consider it as an extenstion to my thesis . In particular, I would like to see how the skills that have been developed since project 1 can improve my approach to my initial research objectives.
